\makelettertitle

I have recently graduated from Portland State University's electrical engineering program with summa cum laude honors for achieving a 3.97/4.00 GPA.  I have already started working on my Master's in Electrical Engineering with a focus on digital integrated circuits and embedded systems.  I am nearly halfway done with my Master's degree thanks to my college's accelerated Masterâ€™s program.  I have been working full-time throughout the past 4 years while getting my degree and I am only 23 years old!

The majority of my education has been entirely focused on electrical engineering and digital circuits.  I have taken multiple classes on Verilog, SystemVerilog, analog circuit design, digital IC design, and various electronics courses.  I have experience with low-level programming including ARM Assembly, C, C++, and Rust.  I also have some experience with formal verification as well as systems engineering.

My senior capstone involved working with a self-balancing robot to create a high-assurance robot controller.  This involved modifying a program called Kind2 to generate embedded friendly Rust code from a language called Lustre.  I was able to independently modify the code generator, and generate an embedded friendly PID and Fuzzy logic controller that successfully balanced the robot.

I am currently working on a personal project called Centennial which is a self-balancing robot written purely in embedded Rust on an STM32f303 processor.  Rust is a really interesting language and it is fun for me to work on a new language that has not been thoroughly explored.

While going to college, I have also been working at Micro Systems Engineering Inc. for almost four years now.   For work, I have completed multiple official validations, verifications, document updates, and have trained people on those document updates.  I have done LabVIEW programming for live production systems and performed a LabVIEW code review for a senior engineer.  I have worked with Epson 6-axis robots and performed Epson RC+ robot training.  I have hand wired multiple mains voltage robot controllers and I have spent countless hours of troubleshooting electrical and mechanical failures.  I am also required to lead a small team of 8-9 specialists on production tasks a few days out of the week.  I absolutely love the people I work with right now and manage to get along with pretty much everyone, but I believe it is time for me to get a job that fits my education.
